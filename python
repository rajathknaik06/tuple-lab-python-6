""" James is managing a list of inventory items in a warehouse. Each item is recorded as a tuple, where the first element is the item ID and the second element is a list of quantities available for that item. James needs to filter out all quantities that are above a certain threshold to find items that have a stock level above this limit. 



Help James by writing a program to process these tuples, filter the quantities from all the available items, and display the results.

Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of tuples.

The next N lines each contain a tuple in the format (ID, [quantity1, quantity2, ...]), where ID is an integer and the list contains integers.

The final line consists of an integer threshold, representing the quantity threshold.

Output format :
The output should be a single line displaying the filtered quantities, space-separated. Each quantity is strictly greater than the given threshold."""


# Read number of tuples
N = int(input())

# Initialize an empty list to collect all values
values = []

# Read the tuples and extract the values
for _ in range(N):
    # Read the input tuple as a string
    input_str = input().strip()
    
    # Remove the surrounding parentheses and split by comma
    input_str = input_str.strip('()')
    parts = input_str.split(', [', 1)  # Split on ', [' to separate ID from the list
    
    # Extract the list part
    list_part = parts[1].strip('[]')  # Remove the closing bracket from the list part
    
    # Convert the list part into a list of integers
    if list_part:
        current_values = [int(x) for x in list_part.split(',')]
    else:
        current_values = []
    
    # Add these values to the main values list
    values.extend(current_values)

# Read the threshold value
threshold = int(input())

# Filter the values based on the threshold (strictly greater than threshold)
filtered_values = [value for value in values if value > threshold]

# Print the result as space-separated values
print(*filtered_values)
